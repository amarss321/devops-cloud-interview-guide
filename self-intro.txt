Day-to-Day Activities (DevOps Engineer – Interview Answer)


As a DevOps Engineer, my day usually starts with a daily stand-up meeting where I share what I worked on yesterday, what I plan to do today, and if I’m facing any blockers.

After the meeting, I check Jira to review my assigned tasks. If there are any urgent issues like a failed build, deployment error, or monitoring alert, I work on fixing those first.

I use tools like Jenkins for CI/CD, Terraform for creating infrastructure in AWS, and Docker for containerizing applications. I also help developers with infrastructure requests and deployments.

If everything is running smoothly, I focus on:

Improving CI/CD pipelines

Automating tasks with shell scripts

Managing Kubernetes deployments using Helm

Monitoring using CloudWatch, Prometheus, or Grafana
