Day-to-Day Activities (DevOps Engineer – Interview Answer)


As part of my day-to-day responsibilities, I begin my work with the daily stand-up meeting, following the Agile methodology which we used in my previous project. During the stand-up, 
I provide updates on:

What I worked on yesterday

What I plan to do today

If I’m blocked, I explain the issue clearly and mention whom I’m collaborating with to get it resolved (e.g., the developer, cloud architect, etc.)

After the stand-up, I move to Jira, which is our project management and ticketing tool. I review all assigned tasks and check for any high-priority tickets, such as:

Production issues

Failing builds or deployments

Monitoring alerts (like CPU spikes or failed pods)

If there's any incident or alert, I begin with root cause analysis, check logs using tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus, or Grafana, and take necessary actions.

If there are no immediate issues, I focus on:

CI/CD pipeline maintenance (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

Writing or improving Terraform/Helm code for infrastructure

Dockerizing applications or updating Kubernetes manifests

Automating manual tasks using shell or Python scripts

Code reviews and collaborating with developers for smooth delivery
